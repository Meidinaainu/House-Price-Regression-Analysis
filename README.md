# House-Price-Regression-Analysis
Multiple Regression Analysis to understand how the independent variables influence the House Price of 1000 data.

**# Variables:**

_Dependent Variable (Y)_: House Price

_Independent Variables (X)_:

1. Square Footage

2. Number of Bedrooms

3. Number of Bathrooms
   
4. Year of Built

5. Lot Size

6. Garage Size

7. Neighbourhood Quality

**# Interpretation:**

Y = -2.007.000 + 199,8 X1 + 10170 X2 + 8245 X3 + 991,5 X4 + 14920 X5 + 5158 X6 + 80,62 X7

X1 (Square Footage): For every increase of one Square Footage unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 199,8 assuming other variables are constant.

X2 (Number of Bedrooms): For every increase of one Number of Bedrooms unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 10170 assuming other variables are constant.

X3 (Number of Bathrooms): For every increase of one Number of Bathrooms unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 8245 assuming other variables are constant.

X4 (Year of Built): For every increase of one Year of Built unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 991,5 assuming other variables are constant.

X5 (Lot Size): For every increase of one Lot Size unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 14920 assuming other variables are constant.

X6 (Garage Size): For every increase of one Garage Size unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 5158 assuming other variables are constant.

X7 (Neighborhood Quality): For every increase of one Neighborhood Quality unit, the value of the House Price will increase by 80,62 assuming other variables are constant.

**# Recommendations:**

To maximize House Prices, sellers are recommended to prioritize increasing the Lot Size, Number of Bedrooms, and Number of Bathrooms because they have the most significant influence on the house price.
